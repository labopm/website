  Most people, in any profession, iterate constantly: they just define the iterations they&rsquo;re 
  making in terms of their immediate outputs, whether those are emails or processes or 
  methods, instead of their strategic goals. In design iteration, teams use iterations 
  as a way to approach the strategic goals of the project as well as fulfill 
  the immediate goals of it.

<p>
  To understand iteration at the immediate, daily level, think about emails. Any email 
  that requires a bit of thought, whether it&rsquo;s for work or a personal matter, requires 
  iteration. When we write thoughtful emails, we think about what to say. We try out 
  wording, delete words, and move things around until we think we have expressed in the 
  best way what we want to say. Then we send it. All those different email versions were 
  iterations of the email. They weren&rsquo;t the email&rsquo;s final form; they 
  weren&rsquo;t even the second or the third. They were many versions that had 
  to be made in order to reach a version that seemed to be the most clear, best way 
  to say what needed to be said.

  Designs must emerge from Discovery. Below is the process diagram from the HCD 
  Discovery Phase Guides and the

  section of this Guide. Here, the diagram is further developed by the use of puzzles called 
  tangrams <button type="button" class="lab__button" id="lab__button_why_tanagrams" onclick="showDescription('why_tanagrams');">&nbsp;</button> 
  to show how each opportunity can be developed into multiple iterations.

      Tangrams are dissection puzzles consisting of seven flat shapes, called tans, 
      which are put together to form shapes. Since a tangram puzzle allows us 
      to create many shapes out of the same component parts, they represent 
      a useful parallel to solving a design problem. If these tangram puzzles 
      were actual design solutions, they would reflect the similarities 
      of their origins while illustrating the process of iterating on ideas.

  The tangrams in the Fields of Opportunity are stand-ins for an iterative design process. Why tangrams? 
  Because a tangram puzzle is a useful way to talk about the cycle of ideation and iteration during the 
  design phase. Every tangram is comprised of the same seven shapes, called tans.
</p>
  
<p>
  To solve a tangram puzzle, a player looks at an outline of a tangram shape 
  and re-creates the shape using all seven tans, with no alterations 
  and no overlaps permitted. Each different tangram is representative of a new iteration 
  within a field of opportunity cone. And, like design iterations, each tangram takes 
  on similar, though not identical, shapes.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, the design team is putting together pieces identified in the Discovery Phase, pieces that, 
  through ideation and iteration, become a new product, service, or system.

    Coming up with only one design option will almost never produce the best solution. That&rsquo;s akin to 
    walking into a supermarket and buying the first apple you see because it&rsquo;s an apple and you need an apple. 
    You don&rsquo;t do that. You examine several apples, considering their size, sweetness, and defects in the light 
    of what you need before making the final decision.

  <p class="lab__split_columns_copy">
    It is the same with design solutions. You work with many possible solutions 
    to arrive at a selection that is best suited to the needs of your participants. 
    All your iterations are related to each other, but none is identical. Instead, 
    they build on one another, just as all tangrams are built from the same seven shapes 
    into an infinite variety of finished creations.

  <p class="lab__split_columns_copy">
    Additionally, like the constraining rules of the tangram puzzle game—only the seven tans, 
    no alterations, and no overlaps—there are many times your solutions will need to address 
    or operate inside some strict constraints dictated by factors like time, costs, and climate. 
    In your work, the team has a need to create something new based on research, insights, 
    and opportunities identified in the Discovery Phase.

<p>
  Sometimes, this process can seem daunting or even pointless, but, as in the Synthesis portion 
  of the Discovery Phase, you will find that the more you and your team work with the ideas 
  for design, the more possibilities you will see.
