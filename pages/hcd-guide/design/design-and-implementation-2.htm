<h2>No &ldquo;hand-offs&rdquo; no &ldquo;waterfall&rdquo;</h2>
<p>
  When the web was young, the &ldquo;waterfall&rdquo; process of development organically developed 
  as a way content-makers and designers could push content to the engineering teams 
  to be put up on the web. The waterfall process of content development is linear: 
  one team completes their tasks and passes to another team who completes their tasks 
  and then pushes to another team, and so on, until the final product is realized.
</p>

<p>
  Broadly, this process was an adaptation of the traditional, factory-like print 
  media workflow from newspapers and magazines. In this process, the Editorial team 
  would write and edit text content, push it to a Design team to lay the text out 
  on a page and work in the illustrations and photographs, and then the Design team 
  would push the layouts to the Printers, who would implement the design by setting 
  the printing presses to churn out the final product.
</p>

<p>
  This, however, is impossible. Even in a completely controlled environment where there 
  will never be any changes or revisions to content, each group doesn&rsquo;t know every 
  constraint and need of next group, so they will of course sometimes produce work 
  that causes problems or questions for future groups in the process.
</p>

<p>
  Plus, that perfect environment is a fantasy; it does not exist. Changes and revisions 
  happen all the time. In newspapers, this meant that if something happened to change 
  the headlines in the early morning edition, Editorial would rush to write new headlines 
  and article text; Design would freak out a little to source a photo and set the text, 
  and the Printers would have to scramble to reframe the entire front page to include 
  this new article. But what happens to the original content? Where does it go? 
  The Printers need to know, and they also have ideas ­— after all, they understand 
  the mechanics of the page better than anyone. They need to be able to talk 
  to Design and Editorial quickly in order to make content decisions. 
  The three groups absolutely had to work together to get changes made in a way 
  that worked for the newspapers&rsquo; readers. And they had to do it fast.
</p>

<p>
  So, in traditional print media, the groups had to overlapping work; they had 
  to talk to each other. This is the same in the current design process. Design teams 
  can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;hand off&rdquo; designs to the people who will implement them. Whether your 
  team is developing print media, a digital product like a website, a real-life object 
  like a kiosk, or a service like a benefits advisory board, working with the people 
  who will implement is crucial to the success of your project. No matter how clear 
  you think you&rsquo;ve been, no matter how top-notch your implementation team is, there 
  will be questions that you need to work out together.
</p>

<p>
  The Design &amp; Implementation phase is analogous to the Communications phase from the 
  HCD Discovery Process: until the Discovery Team effectively communicated their findings 
  to their leadership and partners, the Discovery stage could not be considered complete. 
  Until the Design team has effectively worked with the Implementation team 
  to create final testing through a small pilot and to help that team create 
  an implementation plan, their Design work is not done, because the team has 
  not set the design(s) they crafted up for success: the designs have simply been carefully, 
  painstakingly crafted and then shoved out into the world without support or thought 
  of sustainability.
</p>

<p>
  So never plan to just &ldquo;hand off&rdquo; your design work and roll off a project; stay in 
  it through the first pilot and help you implementation team develop and test an 
  implementation strategy. Only then will you have set your carefully designed solution up 
  for success
