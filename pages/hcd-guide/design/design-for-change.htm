<p>
  The Design phase requires much energy and effort in order to reach 
  the goal of usable products, services, and systems. It sometimes seems 
  as though teams must make all the right decisions or get everything perfect 
  before launch is possible. It&rsquo;s important to remember that no design is 
  permanent; everything will need to change, will have to flex, and will 
  ultimately be succeeded by something that is hopefully more useful and 
  more delightful than the thing originally designed. To prepare for this 
  and to build in space for flexibility and change, many design teams work 
  as though they are always in an iterative loop: constantly designing, 
  testing, delivering, and measuring designs they know aren&rsquo;t perfect but 
  are getting closer and closer to a perceived ideal. This state can last 
  months or even years, and setting up designs to undergo it is an important 
  part of the Design Phase process.

<h2 id="right-opportunity">5.1 Wait for the Right Opportunity</h2>
<p>
  As was said before, the design phase is about making decisions. Almost 
  always you will find yourself having to leave behind what you and the 
  team are certain are desirable, feasible design ideas in order to pursue 
  one of those ideas that is more desirable or feasible. This can feel difficult. 
  You might even feel as if you are not fulfilling the needs of your participants, 
  and therefore not fulfilling your project mandate, because you are 
  not meeting all their needs.
</p>

<p>
  Good ideas, based on strong research, however, have a long shelf life. Better 
  than trying to execute on all the ideas your team has come up with, focus in 
  on the one that you can do well and thoroughly, and wait for the right opportunity 
  to execute on one or some of the others. Note all your design ideas in your project
  documentation, outlining their connection to your research. If possible, share them 
  with other teams who might be able to design for them. But avoid taking 
  on the development of more than one design idea at a time. Your project has 
  a greater potential for success if you allow the team to focus on developing designs 
  for a single idea.
</p>

<p>
  Once the initial design phase is complete, the team can always go back 
  to the additional ideas. If the research was done thoroughly and 
  with excellent documentation, those ideas will almost certainly still be pertinent. 
  You might even be able to update them, given the work you have done 
  in your first design phase. And in the meantime, circumstances might have developed 
  that create opportunities for design ideas that might have previously not been feasible 
  to now be more realistic. In this way, for the good of your design phase, focus 
  on the design ideas you can most reasonably execute immediately, never leaving behind 
  your other ideas, but putting them on the back burner until you either have time, 
  resources, or a better opportunity to address them.

    <h2>Veteran suicide prevention</h2>
    <p>
      In 2017, the Veterans Experience Office undertook a focused project in rural, upstate New 
      York to try to understand and address the issue of suicide among rural veterans. A team 
      of four VEO people and a Lab team member worked for months to connect with private 
      and VA healthcare providers and Veteran Service Organizations in addition to local, 
      county, and state organizations in order to understand the nature of veteran suicide 
      in the area and what was being done to prevent it. In August of 2017, the team presented 
      its findings to both the VA&rsquo;s Office of Suicide Prevention as well as to leaders 
      in the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 2, which covers New York and New Jersey.
    </p>

    <p>
      The team provided multiple design ideas that could be pursued to forward the work 
      already being done in VISN 2 and to scale the best practices from the area 
      to other rural areas experiencing similar veteran suicide crises. The solutions 
      were divided into two groups, Immediately Actionables and Need More Research, 
      to give VEO leadership an idea of how the team might proceed immediately and 
      in the medium term. Disappointingly, the team did not get the go-ahead to pursue 
      their Immediately Actionables, and the design phase seemed to whither. 
      In the face of the VEO reorganization, the team was broken up into different areas 
      of specialty, and the discovery research seemed destined to gather dust.
    </p>

    <p>
      The research, however, was rigorous and sound. A calendar year later, the Centers 
      for Disease Control (CDC) approached The Lab with an audacious idea: apply 
      Human-Centered Design to the problem of suicide among veterans who do not access 
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare. Suddenly, the research 
      from that New York State project had new life. It became part of the literature review 
      for the CDC&rsquo;s project. The Immediately Actionables shed light on the needs 
      of healthcare providers in rural areas specifically, while the Needs More Research ideas 
      fed into the direction of the CDC Discovery Phase.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although not a perfect one-to-one use of the New York State project&rsquo;s findings, 
      the CDC project built upon the previous work in a meaningful way. Currently, 
      the CDC project is itself entering the design phase, and, with one design solution 
      already funded, the team has hopes for the funding of others. So, although 
      a Design Phase opportunity for the New York State research did not present itself, 
      because it was rigorously done and well articulated, it was immediately useful 
      when opportunities for its use arose in another forum.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile lab-hero--hcd-guide__mobile_visible" />

<h2 id="life-cycle">5.2 Designs have a life cycle</h2>
<p>
  Creating new work and sharing it with the world is exciting (and frightening); 
  that is doubtless. Through the long, hard Discovery Phase, through all the meetings 
  where the team had to “sell” their vision, through all the emails flying back 
  and forth between the design and implementation teams, a lot of work goes 
  into realizing a new product, service, or system. There is a pride, an irrecoverable cost, 
  and an emotional association inherent to a designed thing, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the thing 
  has to continue to be owned or exercised by the original team or department that created it.
</p>

<p>
  Products, services, and systems have life cycles, both natural and imposed, usually relative 
  to the amount of time that it takes to build a thing. This idea might feel odd or painful. 
  After all, why go through all the work getting your work into the world if you&rsquo;re already 
  thinking of how it might exit it? We are not taught how to do this; as organizations, 
  we largely do not talk about letting go or taking apart. Instead, when designed products, systems, 
  or services become dysfunctional, we often blame the people who administer them, 
  or we argue that the dysfunction is simply how things are. However, these are not usually accurate reasons; 
  they are ways to avoid the potential pain of change. Humans fight change; it feels dangerous. 
  Not changing, however, holds us back. For this reason, rather than fight natural life cycles, 
  organizations should strive to acknowledge them and move with them.

    <h2>Consumer Financial Protection Agency: policy sunsets</h2>
    <p>
      As a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPB, established 2011) took 
      on the massive task of regulating various types of financial entities in the United States. 
      As they scaled quickly, the leadership of CFPB&rsquo;s Human Capital (Human Resources) office 
      understood that, in the rush of bringing on personnel to address such a broad mission, 
      human capital policies ran the risk of being put into place but never implemented. 
      This might not be because the policies themselves were not good ideas, but, instead, 
      because their intended purpose could have been either subsumed by another, adjacent policy, 
      because the policy did not, in fact, mesh with related policies, or because supportive 
      policies were not pursued.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this reason, the Human Capital leadership instituted a &ldquo;sunset&rdquo; rule: any policy 
      that had not been implemented within two years of its articulation would be sunset, or dropped, 
      from the agency&rsquo;s policy books. The assumption was that any policy that had not gained traction 
      in that time was clearly pretty unnecessary to some people. In this way, CFPB&rsquo;s Human Capital 
      office understood that not all their policy design ideas would necessarily take root, and, 
      in response, built in an automatic means by which to set those policies aside.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is clear thinking, although it might seem a bit sad. However, if a solution does not 
      take root, becomes outdated, or is superseded by another solution, that doesn't mean 
      that the effort going into creating that solution was necessarily wasted. Rather, 
      it means that something has been learned about why things change, about what might cause an 
      idea to not take root, about how and when ideas become outdated, as well as about the 
      natural progression and nature of change, and when and how to allow one idea to supersede 
      another. Instead of keeping design solutions around indefinitely, a better practice is 
      to build in an automatic cycle of re-evaluation for them, so they can be updated if they can 
      and need to be, or they can be sunset, with the reasons why they no longer function becoming 
      part of the knowledge base for new designs.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile lab-hero--hcd-guide__mobile_visible" />
