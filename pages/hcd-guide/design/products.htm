<p>

  Products are defined by economists as made, or manufactured, objects, typically created 
  in a factory setting. They tend to be single-instance interactions between buyer and seller. 
  If you go to a coffee shop and buy a coffee every day, each purchase of that coffee 
  is a new event; the coffee is the product, and the product is new every time you buy it.
</p>

<p>
  More broadly than the 
  <a href="https://hcd-design-phase-concept-guide.netlify.com/productsservices.html" title="National Archives&rsquo; definition" class="usa-prose__hcd-guide_a hcd-guide__print_not_visible">National Archives&rsquo; definition</a> 
  highlighted in the previous section, 
  economists as a group define products quite literally as something you &ldquo;can drop on your foot&rdquo;, 
  and they&rsquo;re not joking. This definition, while appropriate, does not address some 
  of the most important current products we interact with every day: digital products.

<h2 id="products-service">Products-service spectrum</h2>
<p>
  Like the coffee and coffee shop example above, many products and services coexist and serve each other 
  as different parts of systems. Before further exploring the relationship between these two concepts, 
  we can further break products into two broad categories: tangible or traditional products, and digital products.

  <p>
    <b>Tangible products</b> are the traditional playing field of design. They are what 
    most people think of when they think of design in general. Tangible products 
    require manufacturing in some way, and can be used in three dimensional space.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the private sector, they include daily items like coffee cups, while 
    in the public sector they can be items like driver&rsquo;s licenses and passports.

  <p>
    <b>Digital product</b> design has emerged as more and more parts of life 
    are carried out on computerized platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Digital products include items you may use everyday like word processing programs, 
    photo sharing applications, or database applications like your contacts lists. 
    Government examples include the digital filing system from the

<h2 id="products-and-services">Products &amp; services work together</h2>
<p>
  In order to be able to determine whether a product, service, or a combination 
  of the two might be necessary for the project at hand, it&rsquo;s important to be able 
  to recognize and categorize some of these interactions. In parsing different 
  product-service interactions in the public sector, the authors of this Guide 
  have come up with three categories: products that set constraints around categories, 
  products that give access to services, and products that augment services. Find a 
  brief description of each of them with private and public sector examples below.
</p>

<figure class="lab__figure_with_title">
  <h3>Products that set constraints around services</h3>
  <img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/product-constraints_service.svg" width="607" height="221" alt="" class="content-print-img" />
</figure>

<p>
  Products like these are used to box in a service so that consumers can use 
  it in pieces or at certain scales. In the private sector, they include items 
  like insurance, which box in insurance services to include a certain package 
  of services on offer at a certain price point. In the public sector, they include 
  things like drivers&rsquo; licenses classifications. The service of licensing drivers 
  is the umbrella offering; the classifications allow people to use that service 
  at different levels. For example, CDL drivers are licensed to pilot vehicles over 
  a certain number of axles or a certain weight, while a class C license limits 
  the driver to smaller vehicles.
</p>

<figure class="lab__figure_with_title">
  <h3>Products that give access to services</h3>
  <img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/Product-access_to_service.svg" width="607" height="221" alt="" class="content-print-img" />
</figure>

<p>
  Products like these are necessary to access services. Private sector examples 
  include video streaming interfaces: without the interface, the video streaming 
  service might exist, but no one would be able to access it. A good public sector 
  example is New York City&rsquo;s 311 service, which exists as a call center that routes 
  calls as well as a mobile app. Without the product of the phone line or the app, 
  New York City might offer services for non-emergencies, but New Yorkers would 
  not be able to access them.
</p>

<figure class="lab__figure_with_title">
  <h3>Products that augment a service</h3>
  <img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/product-augments_service.svg" width="607" height="258" alt="" class="content-print-img" />
</figure>

<p>
  Products that augment a service are not necessarily needed to constrain 
  or access the service, but they do make using the service more delightful 
  or easy. A private sector example is a to-go coffee cup: while coffee can 
  always be served in multiple-use cups, to-go cups, whether multiple 
  or single use, create a different way to use a coffee service. A public 
  sector example includes the Welcome Kit from the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
  mentioned in the 
  <a href="/hcd-guide/design/team-work.htm" title="&ldquo;In their shoes&rdquo; Design Phase principle" class="usa-prose__hcd-guide_a">&ldquo;In their shoes&rdquo; Design Phase principle</a> 
  previously. While the Welcome Kit is not strictly necessary 
  for accessing all of VA&rsquo;s services   and benefits, it certainly makes 
  those services and benefits easier, more delightful, and is shaping up 
  to show higher rates of navigation success for veterans entering the VA system.
