<h2>2.1. No solitary geniuses</h2>
<p>
  The myth of a solitary genius solving a huge problem no one else could solve is largely just 
  that &mdash; a myth. Although CEOs, sports team leaders, and award-winners tend to get 
  public credit, none of those people achieve their goals without the consistent, robust support 
  and help of a variety of other people.

  The same holds true in design. Although design clusters around a few big names, like 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry" title="Frank Gehry">Frank Gehry,</a> 
  an architect, 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_Ive" title="Jonathon Ive">Jonathon Ive,</a> 
  an industrial designer at Apple, Inc, and 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miuccia_Prada" title="Miuccia Prada">Miuccia Prada,</a> 
  a fashion designer, all of these people have teams with which they work, and no 
  of them designs in a vacuum. Working in teams allows organizations to utilize 
  the unique backgrounds, training, and natural talents of a variety of people. 
  In the same way that design teams go out and talk to participants during Discovery, 
  they also work as teams that espouse multiple disciplines. This allows design teams 
  to hear multiple points during the making phase, in the same way they heard 
  multiple points of view during the Discovery phase.

    <h2>Interdisciplinary NASA teams</h2>
    <p>
      When the NASA undertook to land research robots called rovers on planet Mars, no one person 
      accomplished the task. Not even one leader can take credit. Instead, to land and operate 
      a rover successfully on Mars, NASA assembled multiple teams of flight and mechanical 
      engineers, physicists, rocket scientists, designers, project managers, finance specialists, 
      and others to take on the task.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile lab-hero--hcd-guide__mobile_visible" />

<h2>2.2 In their shoes</h2>
<p>
  If you've heard the old saying &ldquo;it takes all kinds to make the world go &lsquo;round,&rdquo; 
  then you know what this principle is about. Designing for those unlike yourselves depends 
  on the practices of empathy. Practicing empathy means creating designs that will work for 
  the participants.
</p>

<p>
  The word &ldquo;empathy&rdquo; is often used in the design circles to describe an ideal emotional 
  state between designers and participants in which the designers have so deeply learned 
  about the participants&rsquo; experience with a product, service, system, or lack thereof, 
  that they can, as nearly as possible, stand in the shoes of the participants themselves. 
  Practicing this emotional intelligence during the Design phase allows designers 
  to create solutions for people whose experiences they may never have, but with 
  whom they can empathize successfully codesign new or evolved products, services, 
  and systems that improve participants&rsquo; future experiences.
</p>

<p>
  The team has practiced empathy throughout the Discovery phase during Interviews 
  (Discovery Phase Concept Guide, pages 16 &mdash; 21). As you move deeper into design, remember 
  that deep empathy or sympathy you developed. Lean on that while iterating in order 
  to design for your participants, even if they are widely different from yourselves.

    <h2>VEO and Transitioning Veterans</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="#" title="VA Welcome Kit">VA Welcome Kit</a> is one example 
      of using empathy to design better experiences. Through hundreds of interviews 
      with veterans, administrators, and service providers, the Veterans Experience Office 
      has been able to organize these varied offerings, opportunities, and earned benefits 
      into a single, well-designed informational package. Through intensive research with 
      veterans and a value and practice of co-design during the Design phase, the Welcome 
      Kit improves veterans' understanding of available services and benefits in the 
      large VA system. Using plain language, the Kit strives to bring together 
      the myriad phone numbers, registrations, and options a veteran has upon entering VA 
      into a consistent, readable, and modern layout. To design it, VEO spent a year speaking 
      and co-designing with veterans to understand and empathize with their confusion regarding 
      benefits and services during transition. Building this empathy meant VEO sent employees 
      and designers to all parts of the United States to talk to veterans about that experience. 
      What this research found was that veterans bring a range of readiness for civilian life 
      to their period of transition from the military, but that VA could do a lot better to smooth 
      that path with consistent, consumable direction regarding the VA organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this information, the team designed the VA Welcome Kit, now in use across VA. 
      The Welcome Kit research and design teams used empathy to engage with veterans about 
      their experiences. The teams came to understand at a minute level veterans&rsquo; feelings 
      of confusion and frustration with VA. The teams synthesize those learnings into the 
      VA Welcome Kit and tested the product extensively with veterans across the country 
      to ensure its utility. In this way, VEO stepped into the shoes of their product 
      participants in order to improve their earliest experiences of VA. VA&rsquo;s Welcome Kit 
      teams engaged empathetically with, not designed authoritatively for, veterans across 
      the VA system.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile lab-hero--hcd-guide__mobile_visible" />
