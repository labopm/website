<h2>Your work only gets better</h2>
<p>
  Feedback is an integral part of the design process and should be sought out 
  when designing anything, be it product, service, or system. In design, feedback 
  is a multi-step phase during which the design gradually reaches farther 
  and farther outward from the core team in order to gather feedback 
  from an increasingly large pool of feedback providers.

<p>
  It&rsquo;s preferable to gather feedback on several of the team&rsquo;s design iterations. Through 
  feedback, the team is able to understand which design ideas might hold up best 
  in real-world conditions and which ones resonate most with participants. Feedback also 
  allows the team to improve and refine the design iterations, using the feedback reviews 
  to gradually phase out the design iterations that are less successful while refining 
  and focusing the more successful ones.
</p>

<p>
  In this section, see the cycle of feedback and revision for a single design solution. 
  Two steps make up a feedback phase: (1) receiving the feedback from an individual or 
  group and (2) making revisions to the product, service, or system based on that feedback. 
  In each feedback step, the circle of people the team reaches out to for feedback moves 
  farther away from the core team and farther into the field of potential participants.
</p>

<p>
  These feedback sessions can take the form of codesign workshops, prototype testing, 
  or other formats depending on the product, service, or system being tested. Guidance 
  on different feedback formats will appear in the Design Phase Operations Guide. 
  For the second step, design revision, the team revises the design internally in order 
  to integrate the feedback from the people that have been asked. Revision activities 
  generally take the shape of tiny synthesis sessions; you will find guidance on those 
  in the Operation Guide as well.

<h2 id="feedback-and-revision">Feedback & revision process map</h2>
<p>
  This Feedback and Revision Process is a basic framework for how to seek out and integrate feedback 
  into a product or service you have designed. Before jumping into the feedback loops, the team needs 
  to review the primary 
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/hcd-guide/design/design-phase-principles.htm" title="Design Phase principles" class="hcd-guide__print_not_visible">Design Phase principles</a> 
  as well as the principles you developed during Problem Framing. After an intense iteration phase, in which 
  the team gets deeply involved in details, a refocus onto the participants and the strategic level goals 
  of the project will prove useful.
</p>

<p>
  There are two parts to the feedback process:

<h2 id="strategies">Strategies for feedback</h2>
<p>
  Creating a strategy for feedback allows the team to collect feedback logically and methodically. 
  The team should test with people who are all current participants or future participants 
  in the product, service, or system that is being created, but those participants can 
  and should be from different areas of the design object&rsquo;s use. For example, if you test 
  with a front-line participant at one stage of testing, you should try to balance that 
  by testing with a leadership level participant at another. Of course, it&rsquo;s not always possible 
  to perfectly construct feedback testing rounds; the purpose of this guidance is not 
  to create an impossible goal of perfection for testing, but to give guiderails 
  on the best way the team can go about this process.
</p>

<p>
  If testing narrows in on a single participant group for reasons of access or timeline, that&rsquo;s okay, 
  but it will result in a not-as-thoroughly testing tested prototype. For this reason, the designed 
  product, service, or system&rsquo;s potential for success is lessened. While this is sometimes acceptable, 
  it is not desirable. Work with your leadership to find a way to either extend your team&rsquo;s timeline or 
  to gain access to the participants you need.

<h3 id="talk-to">Who to talk to: an expanding galaxy</h3>
<p>
  In testing rounds, the design team needs to get feedback from people who have increasing amounts 
  of distance from the project. This is for two reasons:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Starting with participants previously involved in or aware of the project allows the team 
    to test low fidelity prototypes with people who have context on the project itself. This 
    will provide actionable feedback to increase the refinement of that prototype quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moving outward to people who have no relationship to or awareness of the project includes 
    the perspective of absolutely new participants. This allows the design team to learn about 
    and correct for the issues new users will have without having to find out those issues during 
    a pilot.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  This group will also encounter a closer-to-launch-fidelity prototype, which prepares them 
  for interacting with the new product, service, or system during the pilot phase.
</p>

    <b>Round 1</b>
    <br>
    An ideal person for round 1 feedback is someone who has previously been involved 
    in the project and is familiar with the research or design of phases of it. 
    This can be one of your primarily research or design partners.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Round 2</b>
    <br>
    A good type of person for round 2 feedback is someone who is close to but 
    not directly involved in the research or design of it. This can be the teammate 
    of one of the Round 1 feedback people who you simply haven't talked 
    to directly before.

</div>
<div class="lab__bullet_points_columns lab__bullet_points_column_right">
  <p>
    <b>Round 3</b>
    <br>
    It&rsquo; useful for round 3 feedback to talk to someone who is aware of the project, 
    but not previously involved in the research or design. This can be another teammate 
    of people in Rounds 1 or 2 but, for whatever reasons, has been somewhat distanced 
    from the project development.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Round 4</b>
    <br>
    A strong candidate for round 4 feedback is a person who has not previously been 
    in touch with the team or the other participants about this project at all. This 
    person&rsquo; fresh eyes will help head off any quirks or stumbling blocks that, due 
    to familiarity, the previous testers might have taken for granted.

<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do with feedback: make changes</h2>
<p>
  Each time the team gathers feedback on the designed product, service, 
  or system, document, meet, and discuss that feedback. Think of this process as 
  a smaller, more concentrated version of the Problem Framing process the team underwent 
  during the early parts of your Discovery Phase. In that process, as new information 
  about the large problem frame was uncovered through desk research and the identification 
  of constraints, the team narrowed in on the specific problem frame in which you were going 
  to operate. Similarly, in this process, as the team tests with participants, 
  you will make changes to your prototype to narrow in on a more useful 
  and resonant product, service, or system for your participants.
</p>

<p>
  You&rsquo; work with the resources you have, within the constraints of the product, service, 
  or system you first designed based on your research, to better fit the needs of the 
  ultimate participants in your work. This means tweaks, not systematic changes.
</p>

  <img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/feedback-changes-1.png" width="685" height="" alt="Animation showing the evolution of the original design through slightly different combinations of tangram shapes after every round of feedback, without changing the core of the design." class="content-print-img" />
  <figcaption>
    This animation shows how the design changes as the team receives feedback 
    on the proposed design. After each feedback round, the team makes changes 
    to the design to reflect the needs expressed by the participants. Important 
    to note: the changes should be to the details, not the core concept, 
    of the design. If changes to the core concept of the design appear to be needed, 
    the team should consult their discovery phase findings once again, 
    and restart their design phase.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  If, at this point, you find the need for large scale, thematic or systematic changes, 
  it means the design that you&rsquo; forwarded does not accurately reflect 
  the opportunities identified in the Discovery phase, so the team will need 
  to start again on the design process. This outcome is not failure; indeed, 
  it simply means you know more about what your participants need. And, if 
  you&rsquo; designed in quick, fast iterations, you&rsquo; easily be able to go back 
  and change your direction without adding a great deal of cost or time to your project.
</p>

<p>
  Below, find another visualization of making small changes based on feedback. As you 
  can see, the tangram shape stays roughly the same shape through all the revisions. 
  They all, vaguely, look like a person standing up in different poses. Those different 
  poses are created by moving around some of the pieces that make up the puzzle. 
  These changes are analogous to the changes the design team should be making 
  in the feedback cycle: ones that change details to the overall design, 
  but not the core idea of the design itself.
</p>

  <figcaption>
    This animation shows how, as the team makes changes to the design, the core 
    thematic structure of the design should remain consistent and resonant 
    with the participants&rsquo;core needs. At this stage, changes should be to details, 
    not to overall design themes or needs.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="bringing">Bringing it all together</h2>
<p>
  Through the feedback cycle, the team will talk to a variety of people 
  to gather feedback on the product, service, or system the team is designing. 
  Those people will have different positions to and awareness of the project and 
  its history. As you gather feedback from these people, the team will make changes 
  to its design in response to that input.
</p>

  <img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/feedback-changes-3.png" width="685" height="" alt="Animation of a design iteration in the form of a tangram shape orbiting elliptical rings representing rounds of feedback. Every next ellipse expands further from the viewer to represent the team gathering feedback from people increasingly further away from the team, product, service, or system itself. As the current design iteration (the tangram shape) orbits one feedback loop and moves into another, the shape itself changes to represent the new iteration as a result of that feedback." class="content-print-img" />
  <figcaption>
      This animation demonstrates that, as the team iterates on their design, 
      they should seek out participants who are increasingly removed from the design process. 
      In the first round of feedback, stay close to the participants who are familiar 
      with your project. But, as the iterative loops continue, travel farther away 
      from that group. This ensures that the feedback you receive reflects the experience 
      of people who have not had previous information on your design work, and thusly 
      do not have prior experience with or impression of the design. 
      These people can provide "fresh eyes" on the team&rsquo; design, helping to ensure 
      that your work will be clear to future, wholly new participants.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  If the feedback points the team to an entirely different design, that&rsquo; okay, 
  but the team must throw out its design and start the design process itself again. 
  In this case, the team might want to review their Opportunities from their 
  Discovery Phase and identify a new direction in which to go for their new design.

<h2 id="using-feedback">A note on using feedback</h2>
<p>
  It is important to know that not every piece of feedback from each participant 
  can should be integrated. Be aware of the primary principles of the design phase 
  (and review them if you need to) as well as the principles from your problem 
  framing phase.
</p>

<p>
  If your design resonates deeply, people will be excited about its potential, 
  have great ideas for improvements, and really want to see those improvements. 
  Ensure that you compare those suggestions to your original project scope 
  and technical ability. If you cannot integrate an improvement into this stage, 
  that&rsquo;s okay. Communicate to the participant that their feedback is well-placed 
  and important, and that you will note it for integration into a future version 
  or as an idea for a related product or service.
