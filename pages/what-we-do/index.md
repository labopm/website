<p class="lab-content__lead">
The Lab is a team of designers with diverse backgrounds that helps our partners address complex challenges. Across all of our services, we strive to build human-centered design capacity across the federal government.
</p>

### We teach.

We develop and offer design education classes informed by our experience practicing human-centered design in the federal space to help federal employees respond to and manage the complex challenges they face. To learn more about our educational offerings, visit the [Take a class](../take-a-class/) page.  

### We combine forces.
We partner with federal agencies and other organizations to take on complex public sector challenges. Working with us can unleash new perspectives and fresh approaches to help solve pressing challenges. Learn more on the [Partner with us](partner/) page.

### We share our tools.

We create teaching tools and other resources to help others practice design. [Download these materials for free under Resources](resources/).
<!-- #### We make connections.
Host and participate in events across the country dedicated to bringing innovators together to build and support human-centered design as an effective approach for solving complex challenges. Visit [Events](events/) to learn more about upcoming opportunities. -->

<!-- ## What makes the Lab at OPM different?

We not only help find solutions, we teach people the skills needed to sustain changes. We do this through an integrated blend of classroom-based learning and project-based, hands-on experiences. Individuals can simply attend classes to learn specific skills and the application of design concepts. We also develop long-term partnerships that include a diverse portfolio of projects to advance specific objectives while also developing the capacity at the individual, team, program and organizational levels.

A broad array of opportunities exists for government organizations to work with the Lab. We focus on building problem solving approaches that are effective, scalable and sustainable over the long term. Our partners become advocates, teachers and practitioners of human-centered design. Our return on investment is not only quantified by the measurable positive effects of our work, but by how our partners value and sustain it. -->
