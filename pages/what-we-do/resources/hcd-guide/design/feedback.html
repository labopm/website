<h1>Feedback</h1>
<h3>Your work only gets better.</h3>
<p>Feedback is an integral part of the design process and should be sought out when designing anything, be it product, service, or system. In design, feedback is a multi-step phase during which the design gradually reaches farther and farther outward from the core team in order to gather feedback from an increasingly large pool of feedback providers.</p>

<p>It's preferable to gather feedback on several of the team’s design iterations. Through feedback, the team is able to understand which design ideas might hold up best in real-world conditions and which ones resonate most with participants. Feedback also allows the team to improve and refine the design iterations, using the feedback reviews to gradually phase out the design iterations that are less successful while refining and focusing the more successful ones.</p>

<p>In this section, see the cycle of feedback and revision for a single design solution. Two steps make up a feedback phase: (1) receiving the feedback from an individual or group and (2) making revisions to the product, service, or system based on that feedback. In each feedback step, the circle of people the team reaches out to for feedback moves farther away from the core team and farther into the field of potential participants.</p>

<p>These feedback sessions can take the form of codesign workshops, prototype testing, or other formats depending on the product, service, or system being tested. Guidance on different feedback formats will appear in the Design Phase Operations Guide. For the second step, design revision, the team revises the design internally in order to integrate the feedback from the people that have been asked. Revision activities generally take the shape of tiny synthesis sessions; you will find guidance on those in the Operation Guide as well.</p>

<h2>Feedback & Revision Process Map</h2>
<p>This Feedback and Revision Process is a basic framework for how to seek out and integrate feedback into a product or service you have designed. Before jumping into the feedback loops, the team needs to review the primary <a href= "designphase.html">Design Phase Principles</a> as well as the principles you developed during Problem Framing. After an intense iteration phase, in which the team gets deeply involved in details, a refocus onto the participants and the strategic level goals of the project will prove useful.</p>

<p>There are two parts to the feedback process:</p>
<img src= "images/who_to_talk_to_1.gif" alt= "Animated image of five humanoid figures appearing on the screen one after the other. This animation is meant to show how the design team should talk to different people in sequence in order to get their feedback on and understand their perspective and use of the proposed product, service, or system.">

Each tangram puzzle is roughly the shape a human, and each frame in the sequence shows a minor change to the order of the tangram puzzle pieces to indicate change to the proposed design.">
<p>(2) Making changes to your design based on their feedback.</p>
<h2>Strategies for Feedback</h2>
<p>Creating a strategy for feedback allows the team to collect feedback logically and methodically. The team should test with people who are all current participants or future participants in the product, service, or system that is being created, but those particpants can and should be from different areas of the design object's use. For example, if you test with a front-line participant at one stage of testing, you should try to balance that by testing with a leadership level participant at another. Of course, it's not always possible to perfectly construct feedback testing rounds; the purpose of this guidance is not to create an impossible goal of perfection for testing, but to give guiderails on the best way the team can go about this process.</p>

<p>If testing narrows in on a single participant group for reasons of access or timeline, that's okay, but it will result a not-as-thoroughly testing prototype. For this reason, the designed product, service, or system's potential for success is lessened. While this is sometimes acceptable, it is not desirable. Work with your leadership to find a way to either extend your team's timeline or to gain access to the participants you need.</p>

<h3>Who to Talk To: An Expanding Galaxy</h3>
In testing rounds, the design team needs to get feedback from people who have increasing amounts of distance from the project. This is for two reasons:
<ol>
  <p>1. Starting with participants previously involved in or aware of the project allows the team to test low fidelity prototypes with people who have context on the project itself. This will provide actionable feedback to increase the refinement of that prototype quickly.</p>
  <p>2. Moving outward to people who have no relationship to or awareness of the project includes the perspective of absolutely new participants. This allows the design team to learn about and correct for the issues new users will have without having to find out those issues during a pilot. </p>
  <p>This group will also encounter a closer-to-launch-fidelity prototype, which prepares them for interacting with the new product, service, or system during the pilot phase.</p>
</ol>
<br>
<img src= "images/people-to-talk-to-v3.gif" alt= "Five humanoid figures appear in linear sequence along an orbit-like path. As the humanoids appear, so do rings that seem to indicate orbit. As the orbit rings and the humanoids appear, they get smaller and smaller, indicating that the distance between them and the viewer is increasing. This animation is meant to express how the design team should talk to a sequence of people whose distance away from the team increases as the feedback rounds progress.">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All participants outlined below should be current or future users of the product, service, or system that the team is currently designing. The differences between these people are their closeness to the research and design process of the new product, system, or service.</p>
<p class= "square_left"><strong>Round 1</strong><br>An ideal person for round 1 feedback is someone who has previously been involved in the project and is familiar with the research or design of phases of it. This can be one of your primarily research or design partners.</p>
<p class= "square_right"><strong>Round 2</strong><br>A good type of person for round 2 feedback is someone who is close to but not directly involved in the research or design of it. This can be the teammate of one of the Round 1 feedback people who you simply haven't talked to directly before.</p>
<p class= "square_left"><strong>Round 3</strong><br>It's useful for round 3 feedback to talk to someone who is aware of the project, but not previously involved in the research or design. This can be another teammate of people in Rounds 1 or 2 but, for whatever reasons, has been somewhat distanced from the project development.</p>
<p class= "square_right"><strong>Round 4</strong><br>A strong candidate for round 4 feedback is a person who has not previously been in touch with the team or the other participants about this project at all. This person's fresh eyes will help head off any quirks or stumbling blocks that, due to familiarity, the previous testers might have taken for granted.</p>

<h3>What to Do with Feedback: Make Changes!</h3>
<p>Each time the team gathers feedback on the designed product, service, or system, document, meet, and discuss that feedback. Think of this process as a smaller, more concentrated version of the Problem Framing process the team underwent during the early parts of your Discovery Phase. In that process, as new information about the large problem frame was uncovered through desk research and the identification of constraints, the team narrowed in on the specific problem frame in which you were going to operate. Similarly, in this process, as the team tests with participants, you will make changes to your prototype to narrow in on a more useful and resonant product, service, or system for your participants.</p>

<p>You'll work with the resources you have, within the constraints of the product, service, or system you first designed based on your research, to better fit the needs of the ultimate participants in your work. This means tweaks, not systematic changes.</p>

<img src= "images/shapes_v1.gif" alt= "Animation of tangram shapes as solid outlines of their pieces instead of combinations of the individual pieces appear from left to right on the screen. As in the earlier animation, this animation represents how changes to the individual tangram shapes affects the tangram shape as a whole. In this animation, however, the tangram outlines remain on the screen in sequence, emphasizing their progression and change.">
<p>If, at this point, you find the need for large scale, thematic or systematic changes, it means the design that you've forwarded does not accurately reflect the opportunities identified in the Discovery phase, so the team will need to start again on the design process. This outcome is not failure; indeed, it simply means you know more about what your participants need. And, if you've designed in quick, fast iterations, you'll easily be able to go back and change your direction without adding a great deal of cost or time to your project.</p>

<p>Below, find another visualization of making small changes based on feedback. As you can see, the tangram shape stays roughly the same shape through all the revisions. They all, vaguely, look like a person standing up in different poses. Those different poses are created by moving around some of the pieces that make up the puzzle. These changes are analogous to the changes the design team should be making in the feedback cycle: ones that change details to the overall design, but not the core idea of the design itself.</p>
<img src= "images/revision-dance_v3.gif" alt= "Animation of tangram pieces showing the changes already explored in earlier animations. In this animation, the tangram pieces move around the screen from place to place, indicating the individual changes that make up the shapes outlined in solids above.">

<h3>Bringing It All Together</h3>
Through the feedback cycle, the team will talk to a variety of people to gather feedback on the product, service, or system the team is designing. Those people will have different positions to and awareness of the project and its history. As you gather feedback from these people, the team will make changes to its design in response to that input.</p>
<img src= "images/comet_v2.gif" alt= "Animation of tangram shapes orbiting large, elliptical rings. As the shapes orbit away and then back towards the viewer, it appears inside the orbit ring nearest to the viewer to indicate that this shape is the current shape of the designed product, service, or system. When the shape passes closest to the viewer, both the orbiting shape and the shape in the center of the nearest orbit ring changes to the next shape in the sequence established in the previous animations. This demonstrates that, as the team gathers feedback from people increasingly far away from the team itself, the product, service, or system is updated and change in response.">
<p>If the feedback points the team to an entirely different design, that's okay, but the team must throw out its design and start the design process itself again. In this case, the team might want to review their Opportunities from their Discovery Phase and identify a new direction in which to go for their new design.</p>

<p class= "guide-blue-box"><strong>A Note on Using Feedback:</strong><br>It is important to know that not every piece of feedback from each participant can should be integrated. Be aware of the primary principles of the design phase (and review them if you need to) as well as the principles from your problem framing phase.<br>
<br>
If your design resonates deeply, people will be excited about its potential, have great ideas for improvements, and really want to see those improvements. Ensure that you compare those suggestions to your original project scope and technical ability. If you cannot integrate an improvement into this stage, that’s okay. Communicate to the participant that their feedback is well-placed and important, and that you will note it for integration into a future version or as an idea for a related product or service.</p>
